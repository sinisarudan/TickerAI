# INSTALL

***NOTE***: Before installing backend you need to install Colabo.Space tools. Please read how to install them in the [tools/README.md](../tools/README.md) document.

## Install Colabo Backend Core

(the install routine requires `colabo` logics, not provided in this exemplary code)

```sh
cd colabo
cd src/backend
# NOTE: some of the packages will be installed as tarballs from the colabo.space website
# - http://colabo.space/data/downloads/express-resource-1.0.0.tgz
#   - it is the `express-resource` package on steroids
# - http://colabo.space/data/downloads/deep-assign-2.0.0.tgz
yarn

# we can also run:
npm run clean_full
yarn
```

Then
```
cd apps/colabo-space
yarn
```

***That is all***. Backend of the Colabo.Space ecosystem should be installed now.

The following section is describing the process under hood.

## Install Backend Colabo Puzzles (Packages)

***NOTE***: This is done automatically during the install process (please check the script `prepare` inside the `package.json` for any project) and it is not necessary to be done manually.

These puzzles come from the Colabo Ecosystem and from its [Colabo github repository](https://github.com/Cha-OS/colabo).

We developed colabo tools for automating the task of managing colabo puzzles. They are integrated in the `backend/frontend build/install` process and they are not necessary to run separately.

After installing them (check [tools/README.md](../tools/README.md)), you can just run inside the backend folder.

```sh
# show colabo config file and all puzzles
colabo puzzles-info
# export offered puzzles
colabo puzzles-offer
# install required puzzles
colabo puzzles-install
```

### Explanation

This is just an explanation and not necessary to be done manually, because it is done through the colabo commands.

1. each offered puzzle is exported globally as a npm package (by getting inside the puzzle folder and running `npm link` command)
2. each required puzzles is imported with something like:

```sh
cd src/backend
npm link @colabo-knalledge/b-storage-mongo
```

## Installing on Server

```sh
cd /var/repos/colabo
git checkout -- *
rm src/backend/colabo.config.js~
git pull
cd src/isomorphic
# change colabo.config.js
# puzzles.sudo.offer set to true
joe colabo.config.js
yarn
cd ../backend
# change colabo.config.js
# puzzles.sudo.offer set to true
joe colabo.config.js
yarn
cd apps/tickerai
yarn
```

# Development

## TypeScript

There is `tsconfig.json` file describing what we are interested in compiling and how.

### Problems

- [`npm install v8-profiler` fails with node v7.0.0 on osx #98](https://github.com/node-inspector/v8-profiler/issues/98)
- [Pre-built binaries not found for v8-debug@0.7.7 and node@7.1.0](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector/issues/950)

# Changes


# Full Cleaning previous built and installation

```sh
rm -r node_modules/
rm -r dev_puzzles/*/*/node_modules
rm -r dev_puzzles/*/*/dist
rm -r dist/
```

or `npm run clean_full`

# Deployment

## Webpack Solution

```sh
# get to the backend app
cd tickerai-code
cd src/backend/apps/tickerai

# build with webpack
# rename in `colabo/src/isomorphic/puzzles/knalledge/schema/tests/knalledge-schema.operators.test._ts` as jest crashes at the moment with webpack
yarn build

# TODO: Set config file
# cp config/global-server-climathon.js config/global.js
```
