# Subfilters - ISelection-s
!IMPORTANT: Subfilters - ISelection-s are stored redundantly (for now) in TWO places in the `tickerai-code/src/frontend/puzzles/news/store/store-news-vos.ts :: newsStore`: 
- 1) `markets.marketsSetup.aspects.recommended` and 
- 2) `markets.recommendedSubFilters`
Reasons for this are explained in `tickerai-infrastructure/markets-structure.md`
